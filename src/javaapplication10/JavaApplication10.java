         *You are given an array of 1's 2's and 3's. Sort this list so the 1's are first, 
         * the 2's come second, and the 3's come third. 

        Ex: Input [1, 3, 3, 2, 1] 
        Output [1, 1, 2, 3, 3] 

            But there is a catch!! The algorithm must be one pass, 
          which means no merge/quick sort. Also no extra list allocations are allowed, which means no bucket/radix/counting sorts. 

            You are only permitted to swap elements.
